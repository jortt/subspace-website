			<p>
			Jacob was born and raised on Planet Calgary in the Bowium Nebula.  Soon after moving to the Univas Albertus System he joined the crew of the
			space ship Subspace 620 as an Ensign.  In a year he was promoted to the modest rank of Lt. Junior.  Jacob then served bravely under the glorious
			leadership of Captain Henze for two more years.  When Captain Henze was promoted to Admiral he was suceeded be Captain McLellan.  Unfortuantely
			Captain McLellan's reign as captain ended quickly and in disaster.  When taking the starship Subspace 620 on a routine diplomacy mission to the
			Bowium Nebula, the crew was ambushed in the Univas MountRoyalus System.  The ship was destroyed and Captain McLellan was taken prisoner.  She
			still lives in the MountRoyalus System to this day enduring unknown horrors. <br />
			<br />
			The crew survived the crash but was homeless and lost in an unknown system.  Being the most senior member of the crew and a local of the
			Bowium Nebula, the team looked to Jacob for leadership.  Using Jacob's contacts in the Bowium Nebula the crew returned home to the Univas Edmonton
			System to rebuild their ship.  Captain McLellan was deemed lost and Jacob was promoted to fill the void.  Currently Jacob is still working with
			the crew to rebuild their ship and once again give the crew a home.
