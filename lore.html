				<p>Starfleet Registry NCC-8485</p>
				<p>
				Crew complement: <i>430</i> <br>

				Decommissioned: <i>Nov 2271</i>
				</p>

				<p>Bridge commander: </p>

				  <p>
					<b>Captain Earl Woods</b> (2243 - 2262)
					<br>
					<b>Captain Anthony Longworth</b> (2262 - 2271)
				  </p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
				With Dr. Richard Daystrom's monumental 
				invention of duotronics, Starfleet entered a new era of spacecraft technology, 
				beginning with the new Constitution class vessels. Among the first of those to 
				be commissioned was the <i>U.S.S. Hully-Gully</i>, placed under the command of 
				Earl Woods, a brash upstart with a thirst for adventure.
				</p>
				<p>
				It seems fitting that while on course to their 
				first mission in the Archanis Sector, an unanticipated glitch in the ship's 
				systems resulted in instrument failure, causing the ship to stray over three 
				light-years off course. The source of the malfunction was traced to an 
				accident-prone ensign who carelessly tipped a cup of coffee over a control 
				console while repairing a bipolar electromagnetic converter. Not wishing to 
				appear too autocratic in his discipline style, Captain Woods confined the ensign 
				to quarters to contemplate his behaviour until they reached the next starbase 
				for repairs.
				</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, due to the affected instrumentation, the trip took eighteen months.
				</p>
				<p>
				Even with this initial setback, Captain Woods 
				still went on to lead the <i>Hully-Gully</i> on to many thrilling experiences in 
				nearly twenty years of service, including:
				</p>

				<ul>
				  <li>First contact missions to Benzar, Brentalia, 
				  Ligos II and Xanthras III </li>
				  <li>Prevented an outbreak of Hranilaki brain 
				  fever in the Modean System </li>
				  <li>Thwarted attack by two Klingon 
				  battlecruisers during an astrological survey in the Mutara Sector </li>
				  <li>Attacked and boarded by Orion pirates, but 
				  able to outsmart the marauders and regain control of the ship </li>
				</ul>

				<p>
				In 2262 Captain Woods was finally recognized 
				for his outstanding field work with a promotion to Admiral and DIrector of 
				Starfleet Personnel. ANthony Longworth was assigned as his replacement as 
				captain of the <i>Hully-Gully</i>. Captain Longworth's accomplishments were 
				somewhat overshadowed by another brash upstart named James Kirk, who assumed 
				command of the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i> a few short years later. Nonetheless, he 
				preserved the tenets of the Federation throughout his posting. In particular, 
				the <i>Hully-Gully</i> was honoured in its selection as the ambassadorial escort 
				to the Pelleus peace conference in 2266, and assigned to several missions 
				involving defensive patrols of the Klingon Neutral Zone.
				</p>
				<p>
				Captain Longworth's tenure aboard the <i>Hully-Gully</i> 
				ended prematurely in 2271 when the ship was diverted to an emergency course to 
				the Sol System, when Earth faced the threat from the V'Ger entity. Thankfully, 
				the crisis was averted without severe incident, but the <i>Hully-Gully</i> 
				wasn't quite as fortunate. Spacedock recalled the Constitution class vessel to 
				perform an assessment for upgrade. While the <i>Hully-Gully</i>'s spacefaring 
				condition should have been more than adequate to merit a complete systems 
				upgrade, a bureaucratic decision resulted in its decommissioning. Some 
				speculated that the decision was driven by certain members of Starfleet who 
				wanted to phase out the Constitution class vessels in favour of beginning 
				development of the new Excelsior class starship design.

				<i>U.S.S. Oblivious</i>, Constitution class
			</h2>
			
			<div id="uss-oblivious" class="retractable">
				<p>Starfleet Registry NCC-9091</p>
				<p>
				Crew complement: <i>430</i> <br>
				Commissioned: <i>Oct 2250</i> <br>
				Refit: <i>Feb 2272</i> <br>
				Decommissioned: <i>Apr 2297</i>
				</p>

				<p>Bridge commander: </p>
				<blockquote>
				  <p><b>Captain Andrew 'Andy' Connelly</b> (2272 - 2284) <br>
				  <b>Captain Jim Sandercock</b> (2284 - 2297)</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
				The <i>U.S.S. Oblivious</i> was one of the last 
				of the original Constitution class starships to be upgraded, having completed 
				its fourth five-year tour in 2271. With modifications completed in early 2272 
				the <i>Oblivious</i> was turned over to the command of Andrew Connelly, who 
				proudly took on the club banner on his first mission as a starship captain.
				</p>
				<p>
				Based on Connelly's training in the scientific 
				disciplines, the <i>Oblivious</i> spent most of its time on missions of 
				exploration, but it also participated in a number of peace-keeping endeavours. 
				These diplomatic assignments ultimately influenced Andy's way of thinking. He 
				began impressing the values of friendship and cooperation on to the members of 
				his crew, who weren't always receptive to his cajoling. Dissention among the 
				lower ranks grew as Captain Connelly instituted such unorthodox policies as 
				weekly hug therapy, work shift buddies, &quot;feel good&quot; food menus and community 
				bathing.
				</p>
				<p>
				An ugly situation was slowly developing, but 
				was precluded from occurring when a militant political faction on Caladan IV 
				kidnapped the captain, intending to blackmail the Federation into supporting 
				them in a civil dispute. The crew of the <i>Oblivious</i> wasted no time in 
				sacrificing Captain Connelly, &quot;[sending] a clear message that the Federation 
				would not be bullied into any society's internal problems.&quot; Commander Jim 
				Sandercock, the first officer of the <i>Oblivious/i>, was given the captain's 
				chair and a promotion as reward for properly handling the incident. His first 
				action as captain was to abolish Captain Connelly's abridged regulations, much 
				to the crew's approval.
				</p>
				<p>
				The role of the <i>Oblivious</i> as a peace 
				keeper changed from a passive stance to a more defensive one, often assigned to 
				patrol both the Klingon and Romulan borders. Captain Connelly was also assigned 
				several missions of cultural observations, including the planets Sigma Draconis 
				VI, Beta Antares IV, Gamma Trianguli VI, Ekos, and Betazed. It was based upon 
				Captain Sandercock's recommendation that the Federation initiated first contact 
				procedures with Betazed.
				</p>
				<p>
				In a final footnote, the last mission of the <i>
				Oblivious</i> before its retirement from service involved monitoring the Romulan 
				Neutral Zone, after several outposts reported increased Romulan activity in 
				Sector 27. The <i>Oblivious</i> did not encounter any disturbances during their 
				six-month patrol, but long range sensor sweeps did verify increased traffic to a 
				nearby uninhabited star system. This could have been the first signs ever 
				detected leading up to the Tomed Incident in 2311, although this is pure 
				speculation.

				<blockquote>
				  <p><b>Captain George Skinner</b></p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
				The <i>U.S.S. Incontinent</i> has the dubious 
				distinction of owning the shortest term as the club's flagship, though it 
				certainly isn't the fault of Captain Skinner or his crew. The <i>Incontinent</i> 
				was just barely broken in before it was called in to defend Earth from the Borg 
				at Wolf 395. Captain Skinner was overheard screaming &quot;Run away! Run away!&quot; as 
				all hands abandoned ship moments before it was completely destroyed.
				</p>
				<p>
				Captain Skinner promptly retired from starship 
				service, thereby setting the record as the shortest career as a starship captain 
				in Starfleet history. Preferring to re-immerse himself in the engineering 
				environments where he spent most of his career, Captain Skinner contented 
				himself with a head position at Starfleet Research and Development. As an 
				Admiral, he then went on to reside over the Engineering division of Starfleet 
				Academy, before finally being promoted to Director of R&amp;D.

				<p>Bridge commander: </p>
				<blockquote>
				  <p><b>Captain Malmot</b> (2370 - 2373)
				  <br>
				  <b>Captain Robert L. Leddy</b> (2373)</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
				When Starfleet assigned the <i>Inconceivable</i>, 
				one of the new generation of starships to be recently commissioned, to COmmander 
				Malmot, they beleived they were continuing the long-standing trend of great 
				Vulcan starship captains. Naturally, the <i>Inconceivable</i>'s primary mission 
				involved scientific study of interstellar phenomena.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the late months of 2372 Starfleet 
				Intelligence began receiving reports that the Romulan Star Empire was somehow 
				receiving classified tactical and technological information regarding 
				preparations to defend the Federation from a Gamma Quadrant invasion by the 
				Dominion. SI immediately suspected infiltration by the founders. They thought 
				they might have a suspect when Starfleet Headquarters received a Level 3 
				encrypted message hidden within a standard log report from the <i>Inconceivable</i>. 
				In it, Commander Robert Leddy alluded to Captain Malmot's suspect behaviour, 
				noting several questionable command decisions over the past several months. The 
				report prompted headquarters (under the advisement of SI) to recall the <i>
				Inconceivable</i> to the nearest available starbase under the guise of a 
				maintenance review in order to apprehend Captain Malmot for questioning. 
				Unfortunately, Malmot somehow discovered the true motive for the ship's recall 
				and managed to evade capture with the help of a cloaked Romulan Bird-of-Prey. 
				With the <i>Inconceivable</i> completely disable, Malmot revealed himself to be 
				an agent of the Star Empire (not a Founder as SI had expected). However, as the 
				Romulan ship made its escape, Malmot vowed to bestow his revenge upon Commander 
				Leddy for blowing his cover, however misguided the reason.

				<p>
				The Costanza fought valiantly in the Tuition Wars in 2004 and 2005. In 2005 
				however there was finally a minor victory in what has now been dubbed the War on 
				Tuition. Unfortunetly it was heavily damaged in this fight and the Captain

				<p>Crew complement: <i>65, with additional 112

				<p>Station commander: </p>
				<blockquote>
				  <p><b>Captain Robert L. Leddy (2373)
				  <br>Captain Amanda Blunt (2373 - 2379)
				  <br>Captain Beth (2379- Present)
				</blockquote>
				</b>
				<p>
				Starfleet was rather hesitant to give Commander 
				Leddy immediate command of the <i>Inconceivable</i>, perhaps because he had not 
				earned enough command experience. However, given that Starfleet was still 
				suffering from a shortage of command-rank officers following the Borg attack at 
				Wolf 359, they had little choice but to promote Leddy to Captain. But to avoid 
				risking further incident with the <i>Inconceivable</i>, Starfleet reassigned 
				Captain Leddy to a communications base located in the Univas Albertus system 
				that had just recently finished construction. The only current complexity was 
				the remote location of the orbital station: most of the ship's crew would be 
				literally stranded there until such time that another command staff could be 
				transported to SubSpace 6-20 to retrieve the <i>Inconceivable</i> and the rest 
				of the crew.
				</p>

				<p>
				When the <i>Inconceivable</i> finally docked at 
				the communications station, Captain Leddy debriefed the crew on their 
				assignment: top priority was given to getting SubSpace 6-20 up to full 
				operation, sending word of completion to Starfleet Command as confirmation. The 
				crew was then instructed to await further orders from Command, most likely 
				involving the retrieval of the <i>Inconceivable</i> and its crew.
				</p>
				<p>
				After two months of honest effort, SubSpace 
				6-20 was brought on-line, and the command staff waited with anticipation as the 
				confirmation signal was broadcast back to command headquarters. And waited.
				</p>
				<p>And waited.... </p>
				<p>Are you <i>sure</i> this thing's working?&nbsp; </p>

				<p>
				Captain Blunt was pressed into the command chair and subsequently lost the 
				ship<i> U.S.S. Inconceivable</i> to the a faction of dissidents. Finally an answer 
				from Command was received 4 years into 
				Capt. Blunt's service, and the station received a support ship the USS Costanza.
				</p>

				<p>October 2006</p>
				<p>Captain Beth is now into the second year of her presidency, Captain Blunt has been promoted to Fleet Admiral and givin her own ship to honour her work with the station for so long. Under Lt. Ang's persuasion, many new recruits have joined the station this year.</p>
				<p>July 2007 </p>
				<p>The newly and aptly named USS Blunt and a small crew brave the stars and travel to the Seattle Planet. There they toured numerous shops, and the female staff bought new shoes for their duty uniforms since on the way there Vice Admiral Chris threw out all the pairs of shoes before leaving planet Edmonton. The trip was a rousing success and hopfully many will join us for a trip to Vulcan in the near future! </p>
